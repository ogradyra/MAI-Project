## Effect of the Skin on the Quality of Microwave Breast Images
In recent years, microwave imaging has emerged as a promising imaging modality for the detection of early-stage breast cancer. One approach to microwave imaging of the breast is the use of a mono- or multi-static radar-based system, which works by sending signals into the breast and uses the received signals tocreate a map of scattered energy. Two important elements of these systems are algorithms forearly-stage artefact removal and for breast image reconstruction. An early-stage artefact refersto any undesired components of the received signal such as reflections from the skin or arraycomponents that mask the response from the tumour. The focus of this project is on the effectof the skin on the quality of microwave breast images. This will involve examining the algorithmsused for the removal of skin reflections, which are typically orders of magnitude larger than thetumour response.
