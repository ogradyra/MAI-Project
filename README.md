## Effect of the Skin on the Quality of Microwave Breast Images
In recent years, microwave imaging has emerged as a promising imaging modality for the detection of early-stage breast cancer. One approach to microwave imaging of the breast is the use of a mono- or multi-static radar-based system, which works by sending signals into the breast and uses the received signals to create a map of scattered energy. Two important elements of these systems are algorithms for early-stage artefact removal and for breast image reconstruction. An early-stage artefact refers to any undesired components of the received signal such as reflections from the skin or array components that mask the response from the tumour. The focus of this project is on the effect of the skin on the quality of microwave breast images. This will involve examining the algorithms used for the removal of skin reflections, which are typically orders of magnitude larger than the tumour response.
