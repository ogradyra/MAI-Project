    """Forward-projects the img_model into the time-domain

    Computes the forward projection of the image_model - projecting
    from the image-space to the data-domain / sinogram space.

    Parameters
    ----------
    img_model : array_like
        The model of the object in the image-space
    pix_angs : array_like
        The angle off of the central axis of the antenna of each pixel,
        for each antenna position, in degrees
    pix_dists : array_like
        The distances between each pixel and the antenna, for each
        antenna position, in meters
    prop_speed : float
        The estimated propagation speed of the microwave signal, m/s
    ini_t : float
        The initial time-point used to represent the radar signals in
        the time-domain, in seconds (i.e., the first point in the
        fwd_proj corresponds to the ini_t time-of-response)
    fin_t : float
        The final time-point used to represent the radar signals in the
        time-domain, in seconds (i.e., the last point in the
        fwd_proj corresponds to the fin_t time-of-response)
    n_time_pts : int
        The number of points used to represent the radar signals in the
        time-domain
    ant_rad : float
        The radius of the antenna trajectory during the scan

    Returns
    -------
    fwd_projection : array_like
        The forward projection of the image_model in the time-domain
