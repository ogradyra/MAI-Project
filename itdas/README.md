# itDAS - The Iterative Delay-and-Sum Beamformer

itDAS is an iterative image reconstruction algorithm for use in breast
microwave imaging, based on the delay-and-sum beamformer [1]. 

This GitHub project page contains the implementation of the beamformer used
in its first publication [2] and all the code used to produce the results
presented in [2].

The data used to produce the results presented in [2] are available
[here](https://bit.ly/itDAS-data). To use these data files with this 
repository, place the data files into the `../data/` directory.

The .stl files of the 3D-printable phantoms used in this investigation
are available [here](https://bit.ly/itDAS-phantoms).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

The Python requirements are:

- Python >=3.6
- Libraries in the `requirements.txt` file
    - numpy >= 1.16.2
    - pathlib >= 1.01
    - scipy >= 1.2.1
    - matplotlib >= 3.0.3

### Installing

We recommend using the Anaconda distribution for Python 3.x, which can be
 downloaded [here](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/).
 
After installing a Python distribution, the required libraries can be
installed via the command line. After navigating to the project directory, 
enter the command:
 
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install all the libraries listed in the `requirements.txt` file.

## Usage

### Running the Tests

The `../tests/` folder contains two Python test files and one 
Matlab/Octave test file. 

- The `../tests/check_requirements.py` file checks if the required libraries
 are installed.

### Using the Reconstruction Code

The code used to produce the reconstructions is contained in the `../umbms/`
directory. While the code in this repository is specific to the pre-clinical
imaging system at the University of Manitoba, the code can be adapted for use
with other scan systems.
